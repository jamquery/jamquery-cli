# Jamquery CLI

Command line interface for Jamquery.
Pretty unstable for now.

The program is fully written in Python.


## Build

Install [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in your computer and type in your terminal:

```
pyinstaller -F jamquery.py
```

This will create executable `dist/jamquery` file in the project root.

Or... just download the `jamquery` file in repository root.


## Use

Copy the `jamquery` executable to your path that you like. (e.g. /Users/your-name/bin)

Make sure that those directories are properly listed in $PATH variable.
